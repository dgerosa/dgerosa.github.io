      <p>Not sure what happened here, how the hell did I end up writing a paper with actual <em>radio data</em> that needed to be <em>reduced</em> â¦ Call me an ambulance.</p>

<p>The guy here is 3C186 which is not a postcode but a quasar. A funny one because itâs not centered on the galaxy (itâs a bit off) and itâs also going at another velocity (ciao ciao). One of the leading explanations is that 3C186 is a recoiling black hole, the remnant of black-hole merger is being kicked away (yeah these things can happen). 3C186 also has a radio jet, and that should point in the direction of the black-hole spin. The funny thing is that spin and the kick appear perpendicular to each other, and this is fun because theory says they should actually be parallel. We looked into this a bit carefully and discovered itâs all a lie! The spin and the kick both point along the line of sight and <em>appear</em> perpendicular only because of a super strong projection effect. If this is true, the radio jet should also point straight to us! We then tried to test this with whatever ratio data we could grab (where is that ambulance) and found thatâ¦ mmh, well, itâs a maybe.</p>

      <p>It is a true honor to receive the career Prize for Young Researchers of the Italian Society for General Relativity and Gravitational Physics (SIGRAV). I was awarded the prize in the class of relativistic astrophysics. Itâs amazing to be recognized in my home country; itâs great to be back! Let me thank all my mentors, advisors, collaborators, and now students who are walking with me in the adventure of science.</p>

<p>Here is me with the president of the society Fulvio Ricci. And here are press releases from the <a href="https://www.fisica.unimib.it/it/news/davide-gerosa-premio-assegnato-dalla-societ%C3%A0-italiana-relativit%C3%A0-generale-e-fisica-della">University of Milan-Bicocca</a> and the <a href="https://home.infn.it/it/news-infn/4527-sigrav-premiati-tre-giovani-ricercatori-infn-e-assegnata-a-heino-falcke-e-ad-andrzej-mariusz-trautman-la-medaglia-amaldi">INFN</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Gerosaâs Ph.D. Thesis on âSource modelling at the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomyâ shows an impressive ability to master a rather broad range of topics in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational wave physics. The research initiated by Dr. Gerosa in these areas has triggered follow-up work, providing new important insights and new physical scenarios. The large impact that the work of Dr. Gerosa has already had can only continue to grow.</em></p>

      <p>Much like Spotify, here is our group âWrappedâ, 2023 edition!</p>

<p>Some of the group highlights includeâ¦ We welcomed Pippa, Nick, Arianna, Sshorab, and Matteo. We said bye to Matt who moved to MIT and Nate who moved to Canada, while Daria remains our UK stronghold. Michele got a faculty job, Viola got a postdoc, Davide got a PRIN grant, and Giulia got a SigmaXi grant. We graduated something like 12 BSc students and 4 MSc students (and all 4 of them now have PhD positions). A few long-term visitors (Francesco, Giulia, Harrison) made the group even better for a while. We wrote lots of papers, gave lots of talks, and ate lots of cakes. LIGO is taking data, LISA is being adopted, Virgo has seen better days, and GR is still true. Arianna was in the newspaper, Sshorab broke Davideâs ribs, Alice danced Greek dances, and Costantino got his first American coffee ever. Our gwpopnext conference was a blast and we discussed too much, thunderstorms included.</p>

<p>â¦ now get ready for all the 2024 surprises!</p>

      <p>It took a while (so many technical challengesâ¦) but we made it! <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">Matt</a>âs monster paper is finally out!</p>

<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but itâs not: itâs necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we donât do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), thereâs a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Mattâs paper.</p>

When analyzing gravitational-wave data, looking at one black hole at a time is not enough anymore, the fun part is looking at them all together.

This is obvious for things that do not change (say the masses of the black holes, those are what they are), but becomes a very tricky business for varying quantities (say the spin directions, which is what we look at here).

      <p><em>No black hole is an island entire of itself</em>.</p>

<p>Weâve got many gravitational wave events now. One can look at each of them individually (aka âparameter estimationâ), all of them together (aka âpopulationâ), or each of them individually while theyâre together. Thatâs what we do in this paper: we look at the properties of individual gravitational-wave events in light of the rest of the observed population. The nice thing is that all of these different ways of looking at the data are part of the same statistical tool, which is a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Careful, heavy stats inside, donât do this at home.</p>

<em>âPreviously on the up-down instability.

<p>Todayâs paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian <em>(</em> read <em>: approximate</em>)__ treatment but we couldnât be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding <a href="https://www.black-holes.org/">SXS</a> friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read <em>: the real deal!</em>) code. And the answer isâ¦ yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwgroup/people.php">Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy</a> at the University of Birmingham, UK, invites applications for postdoctoral positions.</p>

<p>The Institute provides a vibrant and diverse environment with expertise covering theoretical and experimental gravitational-wave research, with applications to present and future-generation detectors, theoretical astrophysics, transient astronomy, gravitational-wave source modeling, and general relativity theory. Applications from top researchers in all areas related to gravitational-wave and transient astronomy are encouraged.</p>

<p>Institute faculty members include Andreas Freise, Davide Gerosa, Denis Martynov, Haixing Miao, Christopher Moore, Conor Mow-Lowry, Matt Nicholl, Patricia Schmidt, Silvia Toonen, and Alberto Vecchio.</p>

<p>One postdoctoral appointment is <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=3028">funded by the UK Leverhulme Trust</a> (PI Dr. Davide Gerosa) and is focused on developing astrophysical and statistical predictions for the LISA space mission. The successful candidate will have ample opportunities to explore other areas of gravitational-wave astronomy as well.</p>

<p>Appointments will be for a three-year term starting in the Fall of 2020 and come with generous research and travel budget.</p>

<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications, and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. Complete applications should be received by 27 January 2020 for full consideration. Applications should be sent to Ms. Joanne Cox at: j.s.cox@bham.ac.uk.<br />
Applicants should also arrange for 3 reference letters to be sent by 27 January 2020 to the same email address.</p>

      <p>Weâre accepting applications from prospective PhD students. The deadline is Dec 31, 2019 for positions starting in the Fall of 2020.</p>

<p>Here below is my project description:</p>

<p>_<strong>Astrophysics and phenomenology of gravitational-wave sources with LIGO and LISA</strong><br />
This project concentrates on developing theoretical and astrophysical prediction s of gravitational-wave sources. The first observations of gravitational waves by LIGO have ushered us into the golden age of gravitational-wave discoveries. Thousands of new events are expected to be observed in the next few years as detectors reach their design sensitivities. Such large catalogs of gravitational-wave observations will open new, unprecedented opportunities in terms of both fundamental physics and astrophysics. Crucially, they will need to be faced with increasingly accurate predictions. First, among large catalogs, there will be âgoldenâ events. We expect systems that, because of their properties, are particularly interesting to carry out some specific measurements (perhaps because of their favorable orientations, or because they are very massive, or very rapidly rotating, etc). Second, large catalogs need to be exploited with powerful statistical techniques. In the long run, future facilities like LISA will deliver new kinds of sources providing access to a whole new set of phenomena in both astrophysics and fundamental physics. New theoretical tools and techniques need to be developed (and immediately applied!) to maximize the scientific payoff of current and future gravitational-wave observatories. _</p>

      <p><em>Spoiler alert: this paper is a bit sad.</em></p>

<p>Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are now detected by LIGO on a weekly basis. It would be really cool if LISA (a future space mission targeting low-frequencies gravitational waves) could see them as well. We could do a lot of cool stuff, in both the astro and the theory side of things. In todayâs paper, we try to figure out how easy or hard it will be to extract these signals from the LISA noise. Well, itâs hard. In terms of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio required, we find that this is as high as 15. The number of expected detection becomes discouragingly low <strong>unless</strong> the detector behaves a bit better at high frequencies or black holes with 100 solar masses start floating around.</p>

<p>Long story short, in this paper we compute the irreducible mass of the black holes detected in gravitational waves by LIGO. It was funny to re-discover that gravitational wave detection was indeed the motivation behind Hawking original proof of the area theorem (he had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber">Weber</a>âs claimed detection in mind at the time). The story behind our paper starts as a toy calculation with my undergraduate student Cecilia and ended up in a neat, hopefully informative exploitation of LIGO data. We reparametrized LIGOâs black-hole properties using the rotational and rotational contributions to their total energy, we ranked current gravitational-wave events according to their âirreversibilityâ, and we compute a sort of population version of the area law. Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>An idea, a good one at least, is like a gift. Itâs something which is not yours (indeed, you didnât have it before!) but comes to you, itâs given to you.</em></p>

<p><em>I bike to work, itâs kind of ten minutes from my place to the Cambridge Maths department, but those ten minutes can be more productive than ten hours or ten days in front of my computerâs screen. Itâs morning, your mind should be clear (you should pay attention to cars while biking!), but itâs actually already getting full of what you have to do today. You get to the office, sit down, turn your computer on, and start looking at your problem. You write the equations down, try putting them in a computer, it doesnât work, just nans coming out. You ask a collaborator who hopefully knows something, write the equations down again, it doesnât work. You check in a paper if someone else did something similar, take a break, get annoyed (and here I typically open football websitesâ¦). Oh, and you write the same equations down again, it simply doesnât work.</em></p>

<p><em>At some stage, itâs time to go home, and that moment is precious to me. You know your problem so well, those equations, that crashing piece of code, but you were looking too close. When I close my laptop and get on my way home, fresh air on my face, I can look at the problem from afar. Itâs like looking at those beautiful ancient mosaics. If you look very close, you only see one colored piece, but you canât see any meaning in it. Each piece is crucial to the final piece of art, but the value of each piece is its relation to the bigger picture. You can only appreciate a mosaic if you take one step back and look to the whole picture from afar. Wow. Biking home is my step back. Youâve been looking at all pieces for days, weeks, you know the color of each piece so well that you can finally grasp the relation which puts them together.</em></p>

<p><em>An idea, a good one at least, is like a gift you can say thanks for.</em></p>

      <p>Last week my group and I hosted the international workshop â<a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext/home?authuser=0">Gravitational-wave populations: whatâs next?</a>.â Itâs been a blast!</p>

<p>An unconventional conference, with almost zero talks and the vast majority of the time dedicated to discussions. I report the program here below, just to give you a feeling of what we discussed. The conference started with the question â <em>How many of you entered the field after GW150914?</em> â and virtually everyone raised their hand! It was so refreshing to see our field is alive.</p>

<p>We then went through population synthesis simulations, fancy statistical methods (I promise Iâll understand nonparametric methods one day!), intricacies of injections, catalogs, and overlap with our EM observer friends. We took a break on Wednesday for a social activity on Lake Como, with some folks diving into the lake and others hiking up to a small castle. All before dinner with a fascinating lake (and thunderstorm!) view.</p>

<p>Thanks all for joining and participating so actively. Huge thanks to Emanuele Berti and Salvo Vitale for co-organizing this with me, as well as the local GW group for assistance. Finally, congrats to Amanda Farah and Alex Criswell who won our SIGRAV early career prize.</p>

<p>And if you couldnât make it for whatever reason no worries, weâll do it again!</p>

<p><strong>Conference program in a nutshell.</strong> These are our discussion sessions</p>

      <p>The advanced class âBig data within science and industryâ will take place on September 22nd at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy).</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclass">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclass</a></p>

<p>Data are everywhere. Exploring scientific data is now at the heart of both scientific advances as well as industrial applications. This one-day master class provides a âlearn by exampleâ introduction to the fascinating world of big data, namely pieces of information that are so rich and structured that require targeted analysis techniques loosely referred to as machine learning or artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The class is suitable for advanced MSc students, PhD students, and postdocs who wish to expand their proficiency in handling scientific data. The program features the participation of three world-leading experts from both academia and the private sector, as well as a hands-on experience for all participants.</p>

<p>For students enrolled in the Physics and Astronomy PhD program here at Milano-Bicocca, this 8-hour program will be recognized with 1 CFU. In any case, we are happy to provide attendance certificates.</p>

<p>Interested students should register by ** <em>September 8th, 2023</em>**. Participation is free of charge. We hope to accommodate everyone, but depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected.</p>

      <p>It is a pleasure to announce the workshop âGravitational-wave populations: whatâs next?â which we are currently organizing for next summer:</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext</a></p>

<p>As the catalog of detected gravitational-wave events grows from O(10) to O(100) sources (but think millions in a few decades!), such increasingly detailed information is allowing us to dig deeper into the (astro)physics of compact objects. At the same time, new and more data require appropriately powerful statistical tools to be fully exploited. This highly interactive workshop (fewer talks, more working together!) will be the opportunity to share recent progress, identify what new steps are now needed, and hopefully set the stage for substantial progress in the field.</p>

<p>The workshop will take place on July 10-14, 2023 at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which is located near the city center of Milan, Italy. Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; nearby excursions will take you to the Italian lakes and the stunning Alps.</p>

<p>While we are unable to provide travel support, the workshop will have no registration fee. The workshop will be in person without remote options.</p>

<p>Interested participants should register on the conference website by March 1st, 2023. Depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected. We will be in touch soon after the registration deadline, so please do not make travel plans until you hear back from us. When registering please indicate which of the discussion session(s) you would like to contribute to. Early career scientists will have the opportunity to give flash talks highlighting their science.</p>

      <p>Four students just graduated with projects in our groupâ¦</p>

<p>First, huge congrats to Cecilia Fabbri who got her MSc in Astrophysics. Cecilia (you might <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=4785">remember her</a>) worked on an exciting applied statistics problem (which has already ended up in a <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=6058">poem</a>, but soon in a paper). Her problem got like 10 more people hooked beside us, so we really have to finish it now! From my side, itâs always amazing to see scientists like her growing so much. Cecilia be moving on with a PhD in Nottingham (UK) with Steve Green (and when you come back to visit youâll tell me everything I donât understand about simulation-based inference!). Good luck!</p>

<p>We also supervised three BSc students who defended their short projects:</p>

<p>Congrats all, Spritz time now.</p>

<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate modelsâ¦ stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>

<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. Heâs staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) invites applications for a tenure-track professorship in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a vibrant astrophysics group consisting of 11 faculty members, approximately 25 postdocs, and around 15 PhD students. The group has a strong track record of securing national and international funding, with 6 recently awarded ERC grants. We are part of a larger physics department with about 70 faculty members and are situated on a dynamic campus with 40,000 students. Milan is a modern, international city in northern Italy, close to the stunning Alps, offering a lively cultural scene, excellent food, and a high quality of life.</p>

<p>Current interests of the group include gravitational-wave astronomy, formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and experimental cosmology. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in astrophysics to Milan.</p>

<p>The position will be at the assistant professor level (âRTTâ in the Italian system), a tenure-track appointment with a well-defined path to tenure within either three or six years, depending on performance. The anticipated start date is fall 2025, though this is negotiable. Responsibilities include conducting research at the highest international standards, teaching BSc and MSc courses, mentoring students, and securing external funding.</p>

<p>Interested candidates are invited to apply by June 12th, 2025:<br />
https://www.unimib.it/ateneo/gare-e-concorsi/2025-rtt-027-dipartimento-fisica-g-occhialinigsd-02phys-05-ssd-phys-05a</p>

<p>Knowledge of the Italian language is not required to apply; the online application portal is available in English. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome applications from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>For inquiries, please contact Prof. Michele Fumagalli (michele.fumagalli@unimib.it).</p>

<p>The deadline is <strong>April 24th at noon CEST</strong>.</p>

<p>For instructions, start from the file <em>âGuide to filling in the online application.â</em> Thereâs a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If youâre interested in <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">working with my group</a>, I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3.</p>

<p>You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what youâve done already. Hope this helps!</p>

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) will be opening a tenured professorship in astrophysics, with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and exploitation. With this notice, we invite expressions of interest from potential candidates.</p>

<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational astronomy, with activities covering all bands of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the related experiments (LIGO/Virgo, LISA, ET, PTA). Faculty members with matching interests include Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, and Sesana. The group hosts two large ERC grants and currently counts about 10 PhD students and 15 postdocs. We are part of a wider astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca (with activities in large-scale structures and experimental cosmology) as well as a large Physics department with ~70 faculty members.</p>

<p>We are targeting the opening of a faculty position on a timescale of a few months, with a prospective starting date in the early fall of 2024. Onboarding will be at the associate professor level (âprofessore associatoâ in the Italian system), which is a tenured appointment. Formal application requirements include holding either the Italian national habilitation (ASN) or a comparable position abroad for at least 3 years. We are happy to assist potential candidates with their ASN application.</p>

<p>Current strategic interests include the development of gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines for the LISA space mission. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in relativistic astrophysics and/or gravitational-wave astronomy to Milan.</p>

<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CVs and a short cover letter to bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it by February 15th, 2024. The CV should include the names and email addresses of three referees who might be approached for references.</p>

      <p>Weâre accepting applications from prospective PhD students. The deadline is Dec 31, 2019 for positions starting in the Fall of 2020.</p>

<p>Here below is my project description:</p>

<p>_<strong>Astrophysics and phenomenology of gravitational-wave sources with LIGO and LISA</strong><br />
This project concentrates on developing theoretical and astrophysical prediction s of gravitational-wave sources. The first observations of gravitational waves by LIGO have ushered us into the golden age of gravitational-wave discoveries. Thousands of new events are expected to be observed in the next few years as detectors reach their design sensitivities. Such large catalogs of gravitational-wave observations will open new, unprecedented opportunities in terms of both fundamental physics and astrophysics. Crucially, they will need to be faced with increasingly accurate predictions. First, among large catalogs, there will be âgoldenâ events. We expect systems that, because of their properties, are particularly interesting to carry out some specific measurements (perhaps because of their favorable orientations, or because they are very massive, or very rapidly rotating, etc). Second, large catalogs need to be exploited with powerful statistical techniques. In the long run, future facilities like LISA will deliver new kinds of sources providing access to a whole new set of phenomena in both astrophysics and fundamental physics. New theoretical tools and techniques need to be developed (and immediately applied!) to maximize the scientific payoff of current and future gravitational-wave observatories. _</p>

      <p><em>Spoiler alert: this paper is a bit sad.</em></p>

<p>Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are now detected by LIGO on a weekly basis. It would be really cool if LISA (a future space mission targeting low-frequencies gravitational waves) could see them as well. We could do a lot of cool stuff, in both the astro and the theory side of things. In todayâs paper, we try to figure out how easy or hard it will be to extract these signals from the LISA noise. Well, itâs hard. In terms of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio required, we find that this is as high as 15. The number of expected detection becomes discouragingly low <strong>unless</strong> the detector behaves a bit better at high frequencies or black holes with 100 solar masses start floating around.</p>

    <div class="archive__item-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) invites applications for a tenure-track professorship in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a vibrant astrophysics group consisting of 11 faculty members, approximately 25 postdocs, and around 15 PhD students. The group has a strong track record of securing national and international funding, with 6 recently awarded ERC grants. We are part of a larger physics department with about 70 faculty members and are situated on a dynamic campus with 40,000 students. Milan is a modern, international city in northern Italy, close to the stunning Alps, offering a lively cultural scene, excellent food, and a high quality of life.</p>

<p>Current interests of the group include gravitational-wave astronomy, formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and experimental cosmology. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in astrophysics to Milan.</p>

<p>The position will be at the assistant professor level (âRTTâ in the Italian system), a tenure-track appointment with a well-defined path to tenure within either three or six years, depending on performance. The anticipated start date is fall 2025, though this is negotiable. Responsibilities include conducting research at the highest international standards, teaching BSc and MSc courses, mentoring students, and securing external funding.</p>

<p>Interested candidates are invited to apply by June 12th, 2025:<br />
https://www.unimib.it/ateneo/gare-e-concorsi/2025-rtt-027-dipartimento-fisica-g-occhialinigsd-02phys-05-ssd-phys-05a</p>

<p>Knowledge of the Italian language is not required to apply; the online application portal is available in English. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome applications from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>For inquiries, please contact Prof. Michele Fumagalli (michele.fumagalli@unimib.it).</p>

<p>The deadline is <strong>April 24th at noon CEST</strong>.</p>

<p>For instructions, start from the file <em>âGuide to filling in the online application.â</em> Thereâs a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If youâre interested in <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">working with my group</a>, I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3.</p>

<p>You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what youâve done already. Hope this helps!</p>

      <p>The Italian Society of General Relativity and Gravitation (SIGRAV) announces the 26th SIGRAV Conference, hosted by the University of Milano-Bicocca, to be held in Milan, Italy, from September 8-12, 2025.</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025</a></p>

<p>The conference will cover various aspects of classical and quantum gravity, including tests of General Relativity, cosmology, gravity experiments, and gravitational waves from experimental, theoretical, and data-analysis perspectives.</p>

<p>Participation is open to SIGRAV members and non-members alike, both nationally and internationally. The program will feature a series of broad review talks on various aspects of gravitational physics, as well as contributed talks. The SIGRAV Amaldi medals, the SIGRAV prizes for young researchers, and the Giulio Rampa PhD thesis prize will be awarded during the conference. There will also be a public event dedicated to the 10-year anniversary of the first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914.</p>

<p>Abstracts for contributed talks should submitted by May 31, 2025. We aim to announce the full conference program by the end of June. Registrations will be accepted until July 15, 2025.</p>

<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; you can also explore nearby lakes or venture into the stunning Alps.</p>

If you donât know what to eat for dinner, define a likelihood and sample it (Loutrel et al. 2024). Or put pins on google maps (Borhanian et al. 2024). You look at data, I look at the physics (Bruel et al. 2024).</p>

      <p>Four students just graduated with projects in our groupâ¦</p>

<p>First, huge congrats to Cecilia Fabbri who got her MSc in Astrophysics. Cecilia (you might <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=4785">remember her</a>) worked on an exciting applied statistics problem (which has already ended up in a <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=6058">poem</a>, but soon in a paper). Her problem got like 10 more people hooked beside us, so we really have to finish it now! From my side, itâs always amazing to see scientists like her growing so much. Cecilia be moving on with a PhD in Nottingham (UK) with Steve Green (and when you come back to visit youâll tell me everything I donât understand about simulation-based inference!). Good luck!</p>

<p>We also supervised three BSc students who defended their short projects:</p>

<p>Congrats all, Spritz time now.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>All right I think this is great (but it took me a long time to convince myself and the others thatâs the case!) In gravitational-wave astronomy we measure binaries, that is, pairs of two objects. Our signals have information about the pair as a whole.

Here is an attempt with a fancy machine-learning classifier.</p>

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca welcomes applications for PhD scholarships. This yearâs application deadline is May 14th, 2024 (noon CEST) for positions starting in the Fall of 2024:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application">https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application</a></p>

<p>In particular, we are looking for highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics and gravitational-wave data exploitation. Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational-wave physics, covering activities ranging from astrophysical/numerical modeling to data analysis. The group counts 7 faculty members (Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, Sesana, and an upcoming new hire) together with several postdocs (of which two prize fellows) and PhD students. Candidates will also have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators.</p>

<p>Our PhD admission program includes several âopenâ scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, we are advertising an additional âprojectâ scholarship titled âGravitational-wave source modelingâ which will be supervised by Prof. Davide Gerosa. Candidates wishing to be considered for this opportunity should indicate it explicitly when applying (the number of this position FIS.8). For more information on Gerosaâs group see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group">www.davidegerosa.com/group</a></p>

<p>We strive to build an inclusive group and welcome applications from all interested candidates. For informal inquiries, expressions of interest, and application tips please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

      <p>Not sure what happened here, how the hell did I end up writing a paper with actual <em>radio data</em> that needed to be <em>reduced</em> â¦ Call me an ambulance.</p>

<p>The guy here is 3C186 which is not a postcode but a quasar. A funny one because itâs not centered on the galaxy (itâs a bit off) and itâs also going at another velocity (ciao ciao). One of the leading explanations is that 3C186 is a recoiling black hole, the remnant of black-hole merger is being kicked away (yeah these things can happen). 3C186 also has a radio jet, and that should point in the direction of the black-hole spin. The funny thing is that spin and the kick appear perpendicular to each other, and this is fun because theory says they should actually be parallel. We looked into this a bit carefully and discovered itâs all a lie! The spin and the kick both point along the line of sight and <em>appear</em> perpendicular only because of a super strong projection effect. If this is true, the radio jet should also point straight to us! We then tried to test this with whatever ratio data we could grab (where is that ambulance) and found thatâ¦ mmh, well, itâs a maybe.</p>

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) will be opening a tenured professorship in astrophysics, with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and exploitation. With this notice, we invite expressions of interest from potential candidates.</p>

<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational astronomy, with activities covering all bands of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the related experiments (LIGO/Virgo, LISA, ET, PTA). Faculty members with matching interests include Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, and Sesana. The group hosts two large ERC grants and currently counts about 10 PhD students and 15 postdocs. We are part of a wider astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca (with activities in large-scale structures and experimental cosmology) as well as a large Physics department with ~70 faculty members.</p>

<p>We are targeting the opening of a faculty position on a timescale of a few months, with a prospective starting date in the early fall of 2024. Onboarding will be at the associate professor level (âprofessore associatoâ in the Italian system), which is a tenured appointment. Formal application requirements include holding either the Italian national habilitation (ASN) or a comparable position abroad for at least 3 years. We are happy to assist potential candidates with their ASN application.</p>

<p>Current strategic interests include the development of gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines for the LISA space mission. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in relativistic astrophysics and/or gravitational-wave astronomy to Milan.</p>

<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CVs and a short cover letter to bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it by February 15th, 2024. The CV should include the names and email addresses of three referees who might be approached for references.</p>

      <p>Much like Spotify, here is our group âWrappedâ, 2023 edition!</p>

<p>Some of the group highlights includeâ¦ We welcomed Pippa, Nick, Arianna, Sshorab, and Matteo. We said bye to Matt who moved to MIT and Nate who moved to Canada, while Daria remains our UK stronghold. Michele got a faculty job, Viola got a postdoc, Davide got a PRIN grant, and Giulia got a SigmaXi grant. We graduated something like 12 BSc students and 4 MSc students (and all 4 of them now have PhD positions). A few long-term visitors (Francesco, Giulia, Harrison) made the group even better for a while. We wrote lots of papers, gave lots of talks, and ate lots of cakes. LIGO is taking data, LISA is being adopted, Virgo has seen better days, and GR is still true. Arianna was in the newspaper, Sshorab broke Davideâs ribs, Alice danced Greek dances, and Costantino got his first American coffee ever. Our gwpopnext conference was a blast and we discussed too much, thunderstorms included.</p>

<p>â¦ now get ready for all the 2024 surprises!</p>

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p>

<p>Successful candidates will join the group of Prof. Davide Gerosa and will be part of the âGWminingâ project funded by the European Research Council, with additional support from national grants. Targeted investigations focus on the astrophysical exploitation of gravitational-wave data. We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in population-synthesis simulations of compact binaries, gravitational-wave parameter estimation and population studies, as well as applications of statistical and machine-learning tools to gravity (although we are open to all candidates with a strong gravitational-wave and/or high-energy astrophysics background!). Candidates will have ample opportunities to kickstart new projects with group members and will be strongly encouraged to develop their own independent research lines.</p>

<p>We anticipate awarding up to three positions. Appointments will be for 2+1 years and come with a generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.</p>

<p>The astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Observational Science Board, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), and the Italian Center for Supercomputing (ICSC). Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti. For more information on Gerosaâs group see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group">https://davidegerosa.com/group</a></p>

<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy with history, art, and outstanding food. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.</p>

<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in gravitational (astro)physics. Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent by November 15th, 2023 using this web form:</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9">https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9</a></p>

<p>Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent using the same form by November 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Davide Gerosa at <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a></p>

      <p>Last week my group and I hosted the international workshop â<a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext/home?authuser=0">Gravitational-wave populations: whatâs next?</a>.â Itâs been a blast!</p>

<p>An unconventional conference, with almost zero talks and the vast majority of the time dedicated to discussions. I report the program here below, just to give you a feeling of what we discussed. The conference started with the question â <em>How many of you entered the field after GW150914?</em> â and virtually everyone raised their hand! It was so refreshing to see our field is alive.</p>

<p>We then went through population synthesis simulations, fancy statistical methods (I promise Iâll understand nonparametric methods one day!), intricacies of injections, catalogs, and overlap with our EM observer friends. We took a break on Wednesday for a social activity on Lake Como, with some folks diving into the lake and others hiking up to a small castle. All before dinner with a fascinating lake (and thunderstorm!) view.</p>

<p>Thanks all for joining and participating so actively. Huge thanks to Emanuele Berti and Salvo Vitale for co-organizing this with me, as well as the local GW group for assistance. Finally, congrats to Amanda Farah and Alex Criswell who won our SIGRAV early career prize.</p>

<p>And if you couldnât make it for whatever reason no worries, weâll do it again!</p>

<p><strong>Conference program in a nutshell.</strong> These are our discussion sessions</p>

      <p>The advanced class âBig data within science and industryâ will take place on September 22nd at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy).</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclass">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclass</a></p>

<p>Data are everywhere. Exploring scientific data is now at the heart of both scientific advances as well as industrial applications. This one-day master class provides a âlearn by exampleâ introduction to the fascinating world of big data, namely pieces of information that are so rich and structured that require targeted analysis techniques loosely referred to as machine learning or artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The class is suitable for advanced MSc students, PhD students, and postdocs who wish to expand their proficiency in handling scientific data. The program features the participation of three world-leading experts from both academia and the private sector, as well as a hands-on experience for all participants.</p>

<p>For students enrolled in the Physics and Astronomy PhD program here at Milano-Bicocca, this 8-hour program will be recognized with 1 CFU. In any case, we are happy to provide attendance certificates.</p>

<p>Interested students should register by ** <em>September 8th, 2023</em>**. Participation is free of charge. We hope to accommodate everyone, but depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected.</p>

<p>In particular, the theoretical astrophysics group is looking for highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics, gravitational-wave data exploitation, and numerical relativity. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. Candidates will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well.</p>

<p>Our PhD admission program includes a number of âopenâ scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, our group this year is advertising an additional âprojectâ scholarship titled âGravitational-wave source modelingâ and supervised by Gerosa. Candidates wishing to be considered for this additional opportunity should indicate it explicitly when applying (the number of this position FIS.3).</p>

<p>We strive to build an inclusive group and welcome applications from all interested candidates. More information on the astrophysics group at Bicocca can be found at <a href="https://astro.fisica.unimib.it/">astro.fisica.unimib.it</a>.

      <p>It is a pleasure to announce the workshop âGravitational-wave populations: whatâs next?â which we are currently organizing for next summer:</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext">https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext</a></p>

<p>As the catalog of detected gravitational-wave events grows from O(10) to O(100) sources (but think millions in a few decades!), such increasingly detailed information is allowing us to dig deeper into the (astro)physics of compact objects. At the same time, new and more data require appropriately powerful statistical tools to be fully exploited. This highly interactive workshop (fewer talks, more working together!) will be the opportunity to share recent progress, identify what new steps are now needed, and hopefully set the stage for substantial progress in the field.</p>

<p>The workshop will take place on July 10-14, 2023 at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which is located near the city center of Milan, Italy. Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy and is served by three major airports with worldwide connections. The city is home to art, history, and great food; nearby excursions will take you to the Italian lakes and the stunning Alps.</p>

<p>While we are unable to provide travel support, the workshop will have no registration fee. The workshop will be in person without remote options.</p>

<p>Interested participants should register on the conference website by March 1st, 2023. Depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected. We will be in touch soon after the registration deadline, so please do not make travel plans until you hear back from us. When registering please indicate which of the discussion session(s) you would like to contribute to. Early career scientists will have the opportunity to give flash talks highlighting their science.</p>

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p>

<p>Successful candidates will join the group of Prof. Davide Gerosa and will be part of the âGWminingâ project funded by the European Research Council. Targeted investigations focus on the astrophysical exploitation of gravitational-wave data. We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in population-synthesis simulations of compact binaries, gravitational-wave parameter estimation and population studies, and numerical-relativity surrogate modeling (although we are open to all candidates with a strong gravitational-wave and/or high-energy astrophysics background!). Candidates will have ample opportunities to collaborate and kickstart new projects with group members and will be strongly encouraged to develop their own independent collaborations.</p>

<p>We anticipate awarding up to three positions. Appointments will be for a three-year term and come with generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.</p>

<p>The astrophysics group at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Observational Science Board, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), and the newly formed Italian Center for Supercomputing (ICSC). Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti. For more information on Gerosaâs group see <a href="https://davidegerosa.com/group">https://davidegerosa.com/group </a></p>

<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy with history, art, and outstanding food. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.</p>

<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in gravitational (astro)physics. Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent by November 18th, 2022 using this web form:</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9">https://forms.gle/hnQc3N1xh53YAziH9</a></p>

<p>Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent using the same form by November 18th, 2022.</p>

<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Davide Gerosa at <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>.</p>

<p>For both categories, successful candidates will be awarded a 3yr senior researcher position (at the so-called RTDA level in the Italian system). RTDAs are hired as full employees with related benefits and have limited teaching duties. On top of this, candidates in the Marie Curie winners strand (i) will also be offered a substantial startup grant to hire their own PhD students and postdocs.</p>

<p>All Italian institutions can act as hosts, so I encourage you to contact one of us in the country for more information.</p>

<p>In particular, the gravitational-wave group at the University of Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with activities ranging from relativistic astrophysics. gravitational-wave data analysis, numerical relativity, and gravity theory. The group counts faculty members Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti as well as tens of students and postdocs. The city of Milan is a jewel in the north of Italy with a charming international vibe (as well as mountains, history, art, and outstanding food).</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Lots of âfirstsâ today! My <em>first</em> -year PhD student Viola just put out her <em>first</em> <em>first</em> -author paper. This is about measuring black holes with not one, but two precessing spins. People have been trying to figure out how to tell if at least one of the two spins of a merging black-hole binary is precessing for quite some time now.

In this paper we propose a strategy to identify sources that have the strongest evidence of two processing spins.

      <p>Lots of âfirstsâ today! My <em>first</em> -year PhD student Viola just put out her <em>first</em> <em>first</em> -author paper. This is about measuring black holes with not one, but two precessing spins. People have been trying to figure out how to tell if at least one of the two spins of a merging black-hole binary is precessing for quite some time now. And maybe weâve even done it already for one or two of the current LIGO-Virgo events. But here I must quote that epic Italian commercial from the 90s: â<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDHcjEH2syA&amp;ab_channel=PinguinoMagazine">two gust is megl che one</a>â (which is a terrible Italian-English mishmash on a terrible joke to say that when you eat a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxibon">Maxibon</a> âtwo flavors are better than oneâ).

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for a 3+2 year research position in HPC applications to astrophysics.</p>

<p>The astrophysics group at Milano-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, galactic dynamics, and numerical relativity. This is embedded in a wider astronomical context including both observational and experimental activities. Our group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, the Einstein Telescope Science Board, the European Pulsar Timing Array, and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) via the TEONGRAV national initiative. Staff members with matching interests include Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, Lupi, and Sesana.</p>

<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner. Art, culture, and food are outstanding. The city hosts three international airports with worldwide connections.</p>

<p>This recruitment campaign is part of a wider national initiative supporting HPC-related computational activities throughout the country. This is a major investment program directly supported by the European Union. It will provide the most ideal context for ambitious candidates wishing to develop and apply state-of-the-art computational and machine-learning tools to current astrophysical and gravitational-wave modeling issues.</p>

<p>The researcher will be appointed at the so-called âRTDAâ level for 3 years. The contract can also be extended for 2 more years depending on funding availability. The starting date is negotiable, with the earliest and latest dates on January 1st, 2023 and May 1st, 2023, respectively. RTDA researchers are full-time university employees (with full benefits, such as health insurance and pension plan), have limited teaching duties, and are eligible to fully supervise research MSc student projects. This is an ideal setup for early-career researchers wishing to transition toward research independence and start developing their own group.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will have a PhD in Physics, Astronomy, Computer Science, or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in one or more of the following topics: HPC workflows, GPU software development, computational astrophysics, gravitational-wave astronomy, numerical relativity, statistical data analysis, machine learning.</p>

<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent to <a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a> by June 15th, 2022 for full consideration. Candidates should also arrange for two reference letters to be sent to <a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a> by June 15th, 2022.</p>

<p>We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups. Women are especially encouraged to apply. For inquiries please do not hesitate to contact Bruno Giacomazzo (<a href="mailto:bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it">bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it</a>) or Davide Gerosa (<a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a>).</p>

<p>Here we look at sub-dominant black-hole spin effects in current data from LIGO and Virgo (yeah sorry guysâ¦ our black-hole spin obsession goes on). People have looked at spin precession before, but weâre interested in even more subtle things, namely disentangling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation#:~:text=Nutation%20\(from%20Latin%20n%C5%ABt%C4%81ti%C5%8D%20'nodding,intended%20behaviour%20of%20a%20mechanism.">precession and nutation</a>. This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called âsequential prior conditioningâ (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian statsâ¦). Results are weak today but strong tomorrow.</p>

      <p>It took a while (so many technical challengesâ¦) but we made it! <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">Matt</a>âs monster paper is finally out!</p>

<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but itâs not: itâs necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we donât do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), thereâs a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Mattâs paper.</p>

<p>Long story short, in this paper we compute the irreducible mass of the black holes detected in gravitational waves by LIGO. It was funny to re-discover that gravitational wave detection was indeed the motivation behind Hawking original proof of the area theorem (he had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber">Weber</a>âs claimed detection in mind at the time). The story behind our paper starts as a toy calculation with my undergraduate student Cecilia and ended up in a neat, hopefully informative exploitation of LIGO data. We reparametrized LIGOâs black-hole properties using the rotational and rotational contributions to their total energy, we ranked current gravitational-wave events according to their âirreversibilityâ, and we compute a sort of population version of the area law. Enjoy!</p>

      <p>The University of Milan-Bicocca (Italy) invites expressions of interest for postdoctoral positions in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p>

<p>Successful candidates will join Prof. Davide Gerosa and will constitute the core team of the âGWminingâ project funded by the European Research Council. Targeted investigations include applications of machine-learning techniques to gravitational-wave physics, modeling of black-hole binary populations from their stellar progenitors, relativistic dynamics, and statistical inference. Candidates will have ample opportunities to explore other areas of gravitational-wave astronomy and will be encouraged to develop independent collaborations.</p>

<p>We anticipate awarding two positions. Appointments will be for a three-year term and come with generous research and travel budget. The starting date is negotiable.</p>

<p>The astrophysics group at Milan-Bicocca provides a vibrant environment with expertise covering all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity, as well as a wider astronomical context including observational and experimental activities. The group has tight connections with the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) via the TEONGRAV national initiative. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Giacomazzo, and Dotti.</p>

<p>Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner.</p>

<p>Successful candidates will have a PhD in Physics or related discipline, strong programming skills, and previous experience in one or more of the following topics: gravitational-wave astronomy, stellar evolution, relativistic astrophysics, general relativity, machine learning, statistical inference.</p>

<p>Applications should include a CV with a list of publications and a two-page statement covering research interests and plans. These should be sent to <a href="mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it">davide.gerosa@unimib.it</a> by December 1st, 2021 for full consideration. Candidates should also arrange for at least two, but preferably three, reference letters to be sent to the same address by December 1st, 2021. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome expressions of interest from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>

      <p>I wrote a post for <a href="https://birthofidea.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">The Birth of an Idea</a>, which is a really beautiful blog collecting insights on how scientists start their science. Thanks Vitor for the opportunity to contribute! Here is <a href="http://birthofidea.ist.utl.pt/#gerosa">my post</a>:</p>

<p><em>An idea, a good one at least, is like a gift. Itâs something which is not yours (indeed, you didnât have it before!) but comes to you, itâs given to you.</em></p>

<p><em>I bike to work, itâs kind of ten minutes from my place to the Cambridge Maths department, but those ten minutes can be more productive than ten hours or ten days in front of my computerâs screen. Itâs morning, your mind should be clear (you should pay attention to cars while biking!), but itâs actually already getting full of what you have to do today. You get to the office, sit down, turn your computer on, and start looking at your problem. You write the equations down, try putting them in a computer, it doesnât work, just nans coming out. You ask a collaborator who hopefully knows something, write the equations down again, it doesnât work. You check in a paper if someone else did something similar, take a break, get annoyed (and here I typically open football websitesâ¦). Oh, and you write the same equations down again, it simply doesnât work.</em></p>

<p><em>At some stage, itâs time to go home, and that moment is precious to me. You know your problem so well, those equations, that crashing piece of code, but you were looking too close. When I close my laptop and get on my way home, fresh air on my face, I can look at the problem from afar. Itâs like looking at those beautiful ancient mosaics. If you look very close, you only see one colored piece, but you canât see any meaning in it. Each piece is crucial to the final piece of art, but the value of each piece is its relation to the bigger picture. You can only appreciate a mosaic if you take one step back and look to the whole picture from afar. Wow. Biking home is my step back. Youâve been looking at all pieces for days, weeks, you know the color of each piece so well that you can finally grasp the relation which puts them together.</em></p>

<p><em>An idea, a good one at least, is like a gift you can say thanks for.</em></p>

<p>Here we look at sub-dominant black-hole spin effects in current data from LIGO and Virgo (yeah sorry guysâ¦ our black-hole spin obsession goes on). People have looked at spin precession before, but weâre interested in even more subtle things, namely disentangling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation#:~:text=Nutation%20\(from%20Latin%20n%C5%ABt%C4%81ti%C5%8D%20'nodding,intended%20behaviour%20of%20a%20mechanism.">precession and nutation</a>. This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called âsequential prior conditioningâ (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian statsâ¦). Results are weak today but strong tomorrow.</p>

      <p>It took a while (so many technical challengesâ¦) but we made it! <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">Matt</a>âs monster paper is finally out!</p>

<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but itâs not: itâs necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we donât do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), thereâs a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Mattâs paper.</p>

When analyzing gravitational-wave data, looking at one black hole at a time is not enough anymore, the fun part is looking at them all together. The issue Matt and I are tackling here is that one needs to be consistent with putting together different events when fitting the entire population. This is obvious for things that do not change (say the masses of the black holes, those are what they are), but becomes a very tricky business for varying quantities (say the spin directions, which is what we look at here). In that case, itâs dangerous to put together events taken at different stages of their evolution. And the solution to this problem isâ¦. time travel!

      <p><em>No black hole is an island entire of itself</em>.</p>

<p>Weâve got many gravitational wave events now. One can look at each of them individually (aka âparameter estimationâ), all of them together (aka âpopulationâ), or each of them individually while theyâre together. Thatâs what we do in this paper: we look at the properties of individual gravitational-wave events in light of the rest of the observed population. The nice thing is that all of these different ways of looking at the data are part of the same statistical tool, which is a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Careful, heavy stats inside, donât do this at home.</p>

By the time black holes are detectable by LIGO/Virgo/LISA/whatever, they should have had ample time to become circular. Unless something exciting goes on in their formation, things like clusters, triples, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, etc. And if that happens, we want to see it! This paper contains the first model for gravitational waveforms and black-hole remnants (final mass, spin) trained directly on eccentric numerical relativity simulations. Because eccentric is the new circular.</p>

      <p><strong>Up-down instability S01-E03.</strong><br />
<em>âPreviously on the up-down instability. After finding out that the instability exists (<a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2102">S01-E01</a>) and calculating its analytic endpoint (<a href="../../../../../index.html?p=3077">S01-E02</a>), one terrifying prospect remains.

<p>Todayâs paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian <em>(</em> read <em>: approximate</em>)__ treatment but we couldnât be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding <a href="https://www.black-holes.org/">SXS</a> friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read <em>: the real deal!</em>) code. And the answer isâ¦ yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done.</p>

      <p>Whatâs in between neutron stars and black holes? It looks like neutron stars have a <em>maximum</em> mass of about 2 solar masses while black holes have a <em>minimum</em> mass of about 5. So whatâs in between? Thatâs the popular issue of the âlow mass gapâ. Actually, now we <em>know</em> something must be in there. LIGO and Virgo have seen GW170817, a merger of two neutron stars, which merged in to a black hole with the right mass to populate the gap. Can this population be seen directly with (future) gravitational-wave detectors? Thatâs todayâs paper.</p>

And, believe it or not, some of the popular formulations we use to write down the dynamics of eccentric binary black holes still have coordinates in them. They go away if you take an average of an orbit (Peters, the man!) but thatâs killing some information. In this paper we go back to those old results and show how those gauges can actually be absorbed into the formulation itself.

And, believe it or not, some of the popular formulations we use to write down the dynamics of eccentric binary black holes still have coordinates in them. They go away if you take an average of an orbit (Peters, the man!) but thatâs killing some information. In this paper we go back to those old results and show how those gauges can actually be absorbed into the formulation itself. The paper is on the maths-heavy side of things, but the results are great. Peters, you were basically right, but not quite.</p>

      <p>Not sure what happened here, how the hell did I end up writing a paper with actual <em>radio data</em> that needed to be <em>reduced</em> â¦ Call me an ambulance.</p>

<p>The guy here is 3C186 which is not a postcode but a quasar. A funny one because itâs not centered on the galaxy (itâs a bit off) and itâs also going at another velocity (ciao ciao). One of the leading explanations is that 3C186 is a recoiling black hole, the remnant of black-hole merger is being kicked away (yeah these things can happen). 3C186 also has a radio jet, and that should point in the direction of the black-hole spin. The funny thing is that spin and the kick appear perpendicular to each other, and this is fun because theory says they should actually be parallel. We looked into this a bit carefully and discovered itâs all a lie! The spin and the kick both point along the line of sight and <em>appear</em> perpendicular only because of a super strong projection effect. If this is true, the radio jet should also point straight to us! We then tried to test this with whatever ratio data we could grab (where is that ambulance) and found thatâ¦ mmh, well, itâs a maybe.</p>

This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages and 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. Itâs cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If youâre into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

      <p>Itâs out! The notorious (ask my studentsâ¦) â <em>precession v2</em> â paper is finally out! This took a veeeery long time; we checked and the first commit for this paper is from May 2020 (!). But the result is an exhilarating tour of spin precession at 2PN with 27 pages and 183 (!!!) numbered equations. We rewrote the entire formalism, change how we parametrize things, compute all we could in closed forms, and speed up the computational implementation. Itâs cool, now performing a precession-averaged evolution is a &lt;0.1s operation. If youâre into BH binary spin precession, this is the paper for you. All of this is now part v2 of our <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=658">PRECESSION</a> python module. So long, and thanks for all the spin.</p>

<p>Here we look at sub-dominant black-hole spin effects in current data from LIGO and Virgo (yeah sorry guysâ¦ our black-hole spin obsession goes on). People have looked at spin precession before, but weâre interested in even more subtle things, namely disentangling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation#:~:text=Nutation%20\(from%20Latin%20n%C5%ABt%C4%81ti%C5%8D%20'nodding,intended%20behaviour%20of%20a%20mechanism.">precession and nutation</a>. This is a tricky business, which is made complicated by the fact that this piece of information is hidden behind other parameters that are easier to measure (say the masses of the two black holes). Our paper is an attempt to formulate and systematically exploit something we called âsequential prior conditioningâ (which is: mix&amp;match priors and posteriors in Bayesian statsâ¦). Results are weak today but strong tomorrow.</p>

      <p>It took a while (so many technical challengesâ¦) but we made it! <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">Matt</a>âs monster paper is finally out!</p>

<p>Let me introduce a fully-fledged pipeline to study populations of gravitational-wave events with deep learning. If it sounds cool, well, it <em>is</em> cool (just look at the flowchart in Figure 1!). We can now perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis on GW data but, unlike current state-of-the-art applications that rely on simple functional form, we can use populations inferred from numerical simulations. This might sound like a detail but itâs not: itâs necessary to compare GW data directly against stellar physics. While we donât do that yet here (our simulations are admittedly too simple), thereâs a ton of astrophysics already in this paper. Whether you care about neural networks or hierarchical black-hole mergers (or, why not, both!), sit tight, fasten your seatbelt, and read Mattâs paper.</p>

      <p>Spinning black holes are weird (well, all black holes are weird but those that spin are the worse!).

<p>Long story short, in this paper we compute the irreducible mass of the black holes detected in gravitational waves by LIGO. It was funny to re-discover that gravitational wave detection was indeed the motivation behind Hawking original proof of the area theorem (he had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weber">Weber</a>âs claimed detection in mind at the time). The story behind our paper starts as a toy calculation with my undergraduate student Cecilia and ended up in a neat, hopefully informative exploitation of LIGO data. We reparametrized LIGOâs black-hole properties using the rotational and rotational contributions to their total energy, we ranked current gravitational-wave events according to their âirreversibilityâ, and we compute a sort of population version of the area law. Enjoy!</p>

      <p><em>No black hole is an island entire of itself</em>.</p>

<p>Weâve got many gravitational wave events now. One can look at each of them individually (aka âparameter estimationâ), all of them together (aka âpopulationâ), or each of them individually while theyâre together. Thatâs what we do in this paper: we look at the properties of individual gravitational-wave events in light of the rest of the observed population. The nice thing is that all of these different ways of looking at the data are part of the same statistical tool, which is a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Careful, heavy stats inside, donât do this at home.</p>

<p>Todayâs paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian <em>(</em> read <em>: approximate</em>)__ treatment but we couldnât be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding <a href="https://www.black-holes.org/">SXS</a> friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read <em>: the real deal!</em>) code. And the answer isâ¦ yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done.</p>

      <p><em>Spoiler alert: this paper is a bit sad.</em></p>

<p>Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are now detected by LIGO on a weekly basis. It would be really cool if LISA (a future space mission targeting low-frequencies gravitational waves) could see them as well. We could do a lot of cool stuff, in both the astro and the theory side of things. In todayâs paper, we try to figure out how easy or hard it will be to extract these signals from the LISA noise. Well, itâs hard. In terms of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio required, we find that this is as high as 15. The number of expected detection becomes discouragingly low <strong>unless</strong> the detector behaves a bit better at high frequencies or black holes with 100 solar masses start floating around.</p>

So exciting that we want to make sure once again itâs true; and this is todayâs paper.

The Marie Curie Fellowship program is a prestigious postdoctoral scheme operating at the EU level and, together with <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=5464">Arianna</a>, weâll now have two Marie Curie grantees in the group. Zachosâ winning proposal is titled <em>âBlack hole spin and mass function in gaseous proto-clustersâ</em> (nickname: protoBH).</p>

      <p>Much like Spotify, here is our group âWrappedâ, 2023 edition!</p>

<p>Some of the group highlights includeâ¦ We welcomed Pippa, Nick, Arianna, Sshorab, and Matteo. We said bye to Matt who moved to MIT and Nate who moved to Canada, while Daria remains our UK stronghold. Michele got a faculty job, Viola got a postdoc, Davide got a PRIN grant, and Giulia got a SigmaXi grant. We graduated something like 12 BSc students and 4 MSc students (and all 4 of them now have PhD positions). A few long-term visitors (Francesco, Giulia, Harrison) made the group even better for a while. We wrote lots of papers, gave lots of talks, and ate lots of cakes. LIGO is taking data, LISA is being adopted, Virgo has seen better days, and GR is still true. Arianna was in the newspaper, Sshorab broke Davideâs ribs, Alice danced Greek dances, and Costantino got his first American coffee ever. Our gwpopnext conference was a blast and we discussed too much, thunderstorms included.</p>

<p>â¦ now get ready for all the 2024 surprises!</p>

<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate modelsâ¦ stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>

<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. Heâs staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>

      <p>Wooo! What an amazing performance by two of my students today, who defended their BSc and MSc degrees! Oliver Rossi discussed his BSc project on black holes with large spins completed in collaboration with Viola De Renzis (PhD student in my group). Andrea Geminardi presented the results of his MSc thesis. Andrea studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background with myself, Riccardo Buscicchio (postdoc here in Milan), and Arianna Renzini (postdoc at Caltech). Hope you guys had fun working with us, we certainly did! (and Iâm sorry for my pain-in-the-*** comments on your plotsâ¦). All the best for what comes next!</p>

      <p>Two close collaborators will be visiting my group this winter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~vvarma/">Vijay Varma</a>, postdoc at Caltech and expert of numerical relativity surrogate models, will be here on October 7-11. Get ready for his talk <em><a href="http://talks.bham.ac.uk/talk/index/3838">âBinary black hole simulations: from supercomputers to your laptopâ</a></em> (aka: Everything you ever wanted to know about waveform surrogates).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/giovanni-rosotti#tab-1">Giovanni Rosotti</a>, Veni fellow in Leiden, will be here on November 4-15. He will also give a talk: <em>âThe observational era of planet formationâ</em>. What do planets have to do with black holes? Turns out some stages of their evolution are set by the same equations. We have a lot to learn from each other! Giovanniâs visit is supported by the <a href="https://gwverse.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">GWverse</a> COST Action (thanks EU!).</p>
