      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) invites applications for a tenure-track professorship in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a vibrant astrophysics group consisting of 11 faculty members, approximately 25 postdocs, and around 15 PhD students. The group has a strong track record of securing national and international funding, with 6 recently awarded ERC grants. We are part of a larger physics department with about 70 faculty members and are situated on a dynamic campus with 40,000 students. Milan is a modern, international city in northern Italy, close to the stunning Alps, offering a lively cultural scene, excellent food, and a high quality of life.</p>

<p>Current interests of the group include gravitational-wave astronomy, formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and experimental cosmology. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in astrophysics to Milan.</p>

<p>The position will be at the assistant professor level (“RTT” in the Italian system), a tenure-track appointment with a well-defined path to tenure within either three or six years, depending on performance. The anticipated start date is fall 2025, though this is negotiable. Responsibilities include conducting research at the highest international standards, teaching BSc and MSc courses, mentoring students, and securing external funding.</p>

<p>Interested candidates are invited to apply by June 12th, 2025:<br />
https://www.unimib.it/ateneo/gare-e-concorsi/2025-rtt-027-dipartimento-fisica-g-occhialinigsd-02phys-05-ssd-phys-05a</p>

<p>Knowledge of the Italian language is not required to apply; the online application portal is available in English. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome applications from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>For inquiries, please contact Prof. Michele Fumagalli (michele.fumagalli@unimib.it).</p>

<p>The deadline is <strong>April 24th at noon CEST</strong>.</p>

<p>For instructions, start from the file <em>“Guide to filling in the online application.”</em> There’s a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If you’re interested in <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">working with my group</a>, I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3.</p>

<p>You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what you’ve done already. Hope this helps!</p>

      <p>The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) will be opening a tenured professorship in astrophysics, with a focus on gravitational-wave data analysis and exploitation. With this notice, we invite expressions of interest from potential candidates.</p>

<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a large group in gravitational astronomy, with activities covering all bands of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the related experiments (LIGO/Virgo, LISA, ET, PTA). Faculty members with matching interests include Bortolas, Colpi, Dotti, Gerosa, Giacomazzo, and Sesana. The group hosts two large ERC grants and currently counts about 10 PhD students and 15 postdocs. We are part of a wider astrophysics unit at Milano-Bicocca (with activities in large-scale structures and experimental cosmology) as well as a large Physics department with ~70 faculty members.</p>

<p>We are targeting the opening of a faculty position on a timescale of a few months, with a prospective starting date in the early fall of 2024. Onboarding will be at the associate professor level (“professore associato” in the Italian system), which is a tenured appointment. Formal application requirements include holding either the Italian national habilitation (ASN) or a comparable position abroad for at least 3 years. We are happy to assist potential candidates with their ASN application.</p>

<p>Current strategic interests include the development of gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines for the LISA space mission. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in relativistic astrophysics and/or gravitational-wave astronomy to Milan.</p>

<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CVs and a short cover letter to bruno.giacomazzo@unimib.it by February 15th, 2024. The CV should include the names and email addresses of three referees who might be approached for references.</p>

<p>Here below is my project description:</p>

<p>_<strong>Astrophysics and phenomenology of gravitational-wave sources with LIGO and LISA</strong><br />
This project concentrates on developing theoretical and astrophysical prediction s of gravitational-wave sources. The first observations of gravitational waves by LIGO have ushered us into the golden age of gravitational-wave discoveries. Thousands of new events are expected to be observed in the next few years as detectors reach their design sensitivities. Such large catalogs of gravitational-wave observations will open new, unprecedented opportunities in terms of both fundamental physics and astrophysics. Crucially, they will need to be faced with increasingly accurate predictions. First, among large catalogs, there will be “golden” events. We expect systems that, because of their properties, are particularly interesting to carry out some specific measurements (perhaps because of their favorable orientations, or because they are very massive, or very rapidly rotating, etc). Second, large catalogs need to be exploited with powerful statistical techniques. In the long run, future facilities like LISA will deliver new kinds of sources providing access to a whole new set of phenomena in both astrophysics and fundamental physics. New theoretical tools and techniques need to be developed (and immediately applied!) to maximize the scientific payoff of current and future gravitational-wave observatories. _</p>
