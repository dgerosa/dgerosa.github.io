      <p>Four students just graduated with projects in our group…</p>

<p>First, huge congrats to Cecilia Fabbri who got her MSc in Astrophysics. Cecilia (you might <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=4785">remember her</a>) worked on an exciting applied statistics problem (which has already ended up in a <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=6058">poem</a>, but soon in a paper). Her problem got like 10 more people hooked beside us, so we really have to finish it now! From my side, it’s always amazing to see scientists like her growing so much. Cecilia be moving on with a PhD in Nottingham (UK) with Steve Green (and when you come back to visit you’ll tell me everything I don’t understand about simulation-based inference!). Good luck!</p>

<p>We also supervised three BSc students who defended their short projects:</p>

<p>Congrats all, Spritz time now.</p>

      <p>Two students just completed their Bachelor’s degree with research projects in our group.</p>

<p>I had the honor of heading their graduation committee and could call them “physicists” for the very first time (and the Italian ceremonial sentence is quite imposing: “ <em>coi poteri conferitami…</em> “). Congrats Simone and Leonardo!</p>

      <p>It’s student time! Massive congratulations to two of my students who just graduated.</p>

<p>The star of the day is Matteo Boschini, who completed his MSc project with me after a long visit at the AEI (Postdam, Germany) to collaborate with <a href="https://vijayvarma.com/">Vijay Varma</a>. Matteo worked out an amazing extension of current numerical-relativity surrogate models… stay tuned for a paper because this is going to be cool!</p>

<p>Daniele Chirico completed his BSc studies with a sweet research project on supernova explosions, orbits, and kicks. He’s staying in Milan for his MSc degree now, so wait a bit for his successes!</p>
