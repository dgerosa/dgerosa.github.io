Here we’re looking at extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), that is, a small black hole orbiting a big black hole, which will be (one day) detected by LISA. These signals are nasty (long and of a very complicated morphology). We’re trying something new here – a deep learning called “truncated marginal neural ratio estimation” that does not even require writing down the likelihood of the problem. Just simulate all you can. The answer, this thing is <em>great</em> for narrowing down the parameter space where EMRIs will be, kind of like searches do with current gravitational-wave data, but in a very different way.</p>

<p>Milano-Bicocca hosts a vibrant astrophysics group consisting of 11 faculty members, approximately 25 postdocs, and around 15 PhD students. The group has a strong track record of securing national and international funding, with 6 recently awarded ERC grants. We are part of a larger physics department with about 70 faculty members and are situated on a dynamic campus with 40,000 students. Milan is a modern, international city in northern Italy, close to the stunning Alps, offering a lively cultural scene, excellent food, and a high quality of life.</p>

<p>Current interests of the group include gravitational-wave astronomy, formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and experimental cosmology. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in astrophysics to Milan.</p>

<p>The position will be at the assistant professor level (“RTT” in the Italian system), a tenure-track appointment with a well-defined path to tenure within either three or six years, depending on performance. The anticipated start date is fall 2025, though this is negotiable. Responsibilities include conducting research at the highest international standards, teaching BSc and MSc courses, mentoring students, and securing external funding.</p>

<p>Interested candidates are invited to apply by June 12th, 2025:<br />

<p>Knowledge of the Italian language is not required to apply; the online application portal is available in English. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome applications from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>The deadline is <strong>April 24th at noon CEST</strong>.</p>

<p>For instructions, start from the file <em>“Guide to filling in the online application.”</em> There’s a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If you’re interested in <a href="../../../../../index.html?p=2466">working with my group</a>, I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3.</p>

<p>You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what you’ve done already. Hope this helps!</p>
